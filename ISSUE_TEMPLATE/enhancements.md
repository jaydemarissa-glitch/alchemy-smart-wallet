### Suggestions for Enhancements:
1. **Documentation Improvement:**
   - Add detailed setup instructions for new developers, especially for multi-chain and NFT functionalities.
   - Include screenshots or GIFs for showcasing user experience improvements (e.g., the NFT gallery and 2FA setup).
2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the enhanced toast notification system (enhanced-toast.ts) on mobile devices.
   - Optimize database queries for NFT API endpoints, especially for large datasets.
3. **Testing:**
   - Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for all newly implemented features (e.g., NFT methods in AlchemyService).
   - Conduct stress testing for multi-chain operations, focusing on Avalanche and Solana.
4. **Solana Integration:**
   - Prioritize completing Solana integration and ensure compatibility with the existing architecture.
   - Add fallback mechanisms for unsupported operations on Solana.
5. **Error Handling:**
   - Ensure robust error handling across all newly added API endpoints and improve user-facing error messages.
6. **Analytics and Reporting:**
   - Start Phase 5 by identifying key metrics for user engagement, security, and NFT interactions.
   - Use a service like Google Analytics or Mixpanel for tracking usage patterns.
7. **Backend Optimization:**
   - Plan for Phase 6 by setting up Redis or similar caching mechanisms to improve API response times.
   - Implement rate-limiting and webhook functionality to ensure secure and efficient API usage.

### Remaining Work (From the PR Description):
- Phase 4: Complete Solana integration and network-specific features.
- Phase 5: Analytics and reporting features.
- Phase 6: Backend optimizations (Redis, rate-limiting, webhooks).

### Next Steps:
1. Review and finalize the Solana integration.
2. Prioritize documentation and setup guides for seamless onboarding of new contributors.
3. Begin Analytics and Reporting (Phase 5) and Backend Optimizations (Phase 6) as outlined in the PR.
