### Actionable Steps for Implementation

#### 1. Frontend Deployment:
- Deploy the website or dApp frontend on GitHub Pages or Vercel.
- Use decentralized hosting via Fleek or IPFS for a dApp.

#### 2. Backend and Blockchain Integration:
- Use free blockchain APIs like Alchemy or Infura.
- Implement gasless transactions using Biconomy or Gnosis Safe.

#### 3. Choose a Blockchain:
- Select a blockchain with low or zero gas fees (e.g., Polygon, Avalanche, or StarkNet).
- Use Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum to minimize costs.

#### 4. Smart Contract Development:
- Develop and deploy contracts on testnets for initial testing.
- Use minimal-cost mainnets (Polygon or Avalanche) for production deployment.

#### 5. User Experience:
- Integrate wallets that support gasless interactions.
- Ensure users can interact with the ecosystem without holding native tokens for gas.

#### 6. Monitoring and Feedback:
- Use free analytics tools to track user activity and optimize performance.
- Gather feedback from the initial 100 users to refine the experience.

### How It Works

#### 1. Transaction Fee Deduction:
- When a user sends tokens, coins, or NFTs, the system automatically deducts a small percentage of the transferred amount to cover the relayer fee.
- Example: If the user transfers 100 tokens, the system deducts 0.5 tokens (configurable) and sends 99.5 tokens to the recipient.

#### 2. Gasless Experience for Users:
- The gas fee is covered by the relayer using the deducted portion, ensuring users don’t need to hold native blockchain tokens (like ETH or MATIC) for gas.

#### 3. Smart Contract Implementation:
- Modify the transfer function in the smart contract to:
  - Deduct the relayer fee from the transferred amount.
  - Send the deducted portion to the relayer’s wallet.
  - Send the remaining amount to the recipient.
